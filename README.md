### Introdution
The COVID-19 pandemic also known as coronavirus pandemic is the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It is caused by a coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).
This project presents analysis, visualizations and predictions on COVID-19 pandemic data.

### Data
As there are many data sources available online, the one used in this blog is provided by [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 
*Note that this data is updated daily*

### Prerequisites
- Jupyter (to run notebooks)
- Pandas (for data loading and data processing)
- NumPy (for computing)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Scikit-learn (for predictions)

### Running the code
[`COVID19_Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/chaitanyakasaraneni/covid19_analysis/blob/master/COVID19_Analysis.ipynb) - contains all the code for this project. Run this code using Jupyter.

### Predictions
Three variants of Linear Regression are used in this project for predicting the count of future cases.

***Note**: This is just a simple model and the results are not accurate. For more accurate predictions, try using other regression or deep learning techniques.*
